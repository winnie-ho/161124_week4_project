# Programming & Web Fundamentals

Over the next week you have the chance to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

- Ruby fundamentals
- TDD (where appropriate)
- OOP
- Web Programming ( REST/MVC )
- Databases with CRUD actions





## MoneyCashboard

You want to start tracking your spending in an attempt to be more frugal with money.

You must be able to create new Transactions ( which should include merchant name e.g. Tesco and value ) which has an associated Tag (e.g. ‘food’). It would then be able to track a total. Your Account could then be displayed in a view.

Suggested MVP:

- Create new transactions
- Display all transactions
- Display total expenditure
- Display total expenditure by tag

Your app could:

- CRUD actions for the transations
- Create route that sends down Account data as JSON

MVP: 

 - A list of all their animals and their admission date

The owner of Crazy Keith's Music Store, Jeff 3, wants an app which will help him keep on top of his store inventory. He does not want an app that customers will see, but he will use to check stock levels and see what he needs to order soon.
